# Context Restore Point

## Where We Are
- **Current Task**: Gorilla Tag Math Game - Architecture Phase Complete
- **Goal**: Build a web-based math education game with Gorilla Tag theming

## Execution State
- **Active Files**:
  - `.context-foundry/architecture.md` (Just created - primary reference)
  - `.context-foundry/scout-report.md` (Reference - requirements source)
- **Recent Changes**:
  - Created comprehensive architecture.md with full system design
  - Defined 6 core modules: MathEngine, ScoreManager, DifficultyManager, GameController, UIController, ThemeEngine
  - Established file structure with `js/`, `css/`, `assets/`, `tests/` directories
  - Specified all interfaces and data models
- **Errors/Blockers**: None - greenfield project ready for implementation

## Mental Scrapbook
- **Tech Choice**: Vanilla JS, no frameworks - keeps it simple and dependency-free
- **Difficulty Levels**: 3 levels (Easy/Medium/Hard) with adaptive scaling
- **Storage Key**: `gorillaTagMath_playerData` for localStorage
- **Trademark Avoidance**: Use "inspired by" styling, no official Gorilla Tag assets
- **Target Audience**: Ages 6-12, so feedback should be encouraging, not punishing

## DIRECTIVE FOR NEXT AGENT
**Your First Step**: Begin implementation by creating the directory structure and `index.html` boilerplate. Start with the Math Engine (`js/math-engine.js`) as it has no dependencies and is the core logic. Follow Implementation Step 1 and 2 from architecture.md.
