# 🧠 Context Restore Point

## 📍 Where We Are
- **Current Task**: Gorilla Tag Math Game - Scout Phase Complete
- **Goal**: Build an educational math game with Gorilla Tag VR game theming

## 🚧 Execution State
- **Active Files**:
  - `.context-foundry/scout-report.md` (Complete)
- **Recent Changes**:
  - Researched Gorilla Tag VR game mechanics and visual style
  - Created scout report with stack decisions (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
  - Identified architecture: static web app, modular math engine
- **Errors/Blockers**: None

## 🧠 Mental Scrapbook
- Gorilla Tag is a VR game with legless gorillas ("monkes"), low-poly art style
- Web-based implementation (not VR) - accessible via browser
- Use "inspired-by" theming, not official Gorilla Tag assets (trademark concern)
- Target: elementary school math (arithmetic operations)
- No backend needed - localStorage for persistence

## ⏭️ DIRECTIVE FOR NEXT AGENT
**Your First Step**: Begin Architect phase - design the file structure and create implementation blueprint. Key files needed: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `game.js`. Consider gorilla character representation (CSS art or emoji) and math difficulty progression system.
