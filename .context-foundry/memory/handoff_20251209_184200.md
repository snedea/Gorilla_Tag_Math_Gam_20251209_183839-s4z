# Context Restore Point

## Where We Are
- **Current Task**: Gorilla Tag Math Game - Architect Phase Complete
- **Goal**: Build an educational math game with Gorilla Tag VR game theming

## Execution State
- **Active Files**:
  - `.context-foundry/architecture.md` (Complete - validated)
  - `.context-foundry/scout-report.md` (Reference)
- **Recent Changes**:
  - Verified architecture.md contains all required sections
  - Confirmed Technology Stack and System Architecture sections present
  - Architecture defines 6 modules: Math Engine, Difficulty Manager, Score Manager, Game Controller, UI Controller, Theme Engine
- **Errors/Blockers**: None

## Mental Scrapbook
- Stack: Vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript - no frameworks
- Architecture: Modular MVC-inspired, single-page game
- 6 JS modules in `js/` folder, 3 CSS files in `css/` folder
- localStorage key: `gorillaTagMath_playerData`
- 3 difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Adaptive difficulty: 3 correct = level up, 3 wrong = level down
- Gorilla character via SVG/CSS (avoid trademarked assets)
- Testing: Jest for unit tests on logic modules

## Key Architecture Decisions
1. **File Structure**: `index.html` at root, `js/` and `css/` subdirectories
2. **Modules**: Loosely coupled via callbacks - MathEngine, DifficultyManager, ScoreManager, GameController, UIController, ThemeEngine
3. **Game States**: menu -> playing -> feedback -> gameover
4. **Persistence**: localStorage for high scores and settings
5. **No build system**: Static files only, optional bundler for production

## DIRECTIVE FOR NEXT AGENT
**Your First Step**: Begin Builder phase. Start with Step 1 from architecture.md:
1. Create the directory structure (`css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, `tests/`)
2. Create `index.html` with basic HTML structure (menu, game, gameover screens)
3. Create placeholder CSS files (`main.css`, `theme.css`, `animations.css`)
4. Then implement Math Engine module (`js/math-engine.js`) with unit tests

Priority files to create first:
- `index.html`
- `css/main.css`
- `js/math-engine.js`
- `js/app.js`
