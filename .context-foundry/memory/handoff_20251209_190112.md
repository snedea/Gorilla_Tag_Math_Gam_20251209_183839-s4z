## ⏭️ DIRECTIVE FOR NEXT AGENT
**Your First Step**: The game is complete and screenshots have been captured. If further verification is needed:
1. Start server: `python3 -m http.server 3000`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Manually play through 20 questions to capture game over screen
4. Or run unit tests: `npx jest tests/` to verify logic modules

**Screenshots captured**:
- `01_main_menu.png` - Title screen with gorilla
- `02_game_playing.png` - Active gameplay
- `03_answer_entered.png` - Answer input state
- `04_answer_feedback.png` - Feedback display
- `05_game_progress.png` - Mid-game progress
- `06_settings_modal.png` - Settings UI
- `07_game_over.png` - (needs manual capture for true game over state)
