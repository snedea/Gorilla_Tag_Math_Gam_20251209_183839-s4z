# Context Restore Point

## Where We Are
- **Current Task**: Documentation Phase Complete
- **Goal**: Comprehensive documentation for Gorilla Tag Math Game

## Execution State
- **Active Files**:
  - `README.md` - Project overview, installation, usage (already existed, kept as-is)
  - `docs/API.md` - API documentation for all JavaScript modules (created)
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and design patterns (created)
  - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines (created)
- **Recent Changes**:
  - Created comprehensive API documentation covering all 6 JavaScript modules
  - Created architecture documentation with diagrams, data flow, state management
  - Created contributing guidelines with code style, testing, and PR process
  - All documentation files created in `docs/` directory
- **Errors/Blockers**:
  - Artifact manifest registration failed (Python module not available in environment)
  - This is non-blocking - documentation files exist and are complete

## Mental Scrapbook
- Game is vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript SPA with no frameworks
- Uses Revealing Module Pattern (IIFE) for all JavaScript modules
- Six main modules: MathEngine, DifficultyManager, ScoreManager, GameController, UIController, ThemeEngine
- MathEngine is stateless (pure functions), others maintain state
- localStorage used for persistence with key `gorillaTagMath_playerData`
- CSS-only gorilla character (avoiding trademarked assets)
- Three difficulty levels with adaptive adjustment based on streaks

## DIRECTIVE FOR NEXT AGENT
**Your First Step**: Documentation phase is COMPLETE. The project is ready for final review or deployment.

**Documentation created**:
1. `README.md` - Already existed with comprehensive project overview
2. `docs/API.md` - Full API documentation for all modules
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture, data flow, state management
4. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for contributors

**To verify documentation**:
```bash
cat README.md
cat docs/API.md
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
cat docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**To run the game**:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**To run tests**:
```bash
npm test
```
